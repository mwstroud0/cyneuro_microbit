1. Attach the microbit to your shoe.
2. Press button A to start recording the "rest" state (keep your foot still).
3. When the LED screen shows all red, press button A to move to the "shake" state (shake your foot).
4. When the LED screen shows all red, press button A to move to the "walk" state (start walking).
5. After some music plays, you will see a prediction of 0, 1, or 2 from the microbit for rest, shake, walk respectively based on the current accelerometer data.

## Integrate & Fire Neuron
### Instructions
1. Press the capacitor logo to inject current. The LED screen will light up to show a spiking neuron.
2. Press button A to decrease the injected current amount. Press button B to increase the injected current amount
